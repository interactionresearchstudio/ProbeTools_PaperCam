# ProbeTools_PaperCam
Paper housing for the Probe Tools Arduino Camera

## Tips for selecting your paper

Choose 2 colours of A4 paper that will become your inner and outer camera case, plus an extra unseen piece of A4 paper. (recommended weight 250 gsm) 

Choose to either laser cut or hand cut the Paper Camera

If opting for the laser cutting option then cut & fold the inner and outer case on the laser 
cutter.  Cut an additional six paper risers (80 x 36mm). (5 cutting operations)
